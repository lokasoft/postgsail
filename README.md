## About The Project

https://github.com/xbgmsharp/signalk-postgsail/assets/1498985/b2669c39-11ad-4a50-9f91-9397f9057ee8

Effortless cloud based solution for storing and sharing your SignalK data. Allow you to effortlessly log your sails and monitor your boat with historical data.

Here's how:

It is all about SQL, object-relational, time-series, spatial databases with a bit of python.

PostgSail is an open-source alternative to traditional vessel data management.
It is based on a well known open-source technology stack, Signalk, PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, PostGIS, PostgREST. It does perfectly integrate with standard monitoring tool stack like Grafana.

To understand the why and how, you might want to read [Why.md](https://github.com/xbgmsharp/postgsail/blob/main/Why.md)

## Features

- Automatically log your voyages without manually starting or stopping a trip.
- Automatically capture the details of your voyages (boat speed, heading, wind speed, etc).
- Timelapse video your trips, with or without time control.
- Add custom notes to your logs.
- Export to CSV, GPX, GeoJSON, KML and download your logs.
- Export your logs as image (PNG) or video (MP4).
- Aggregate your trip statistics: Longest voyage, time spent at anchorages, home ports etc.
- See your moorages on a global map, with incoming and outgoing voyages from each trip.
- Monitor your boat (position, depth, wind, temperature, battery charge status, etc.) remotely.
- History: view trends.
- Alert monitoring: get notification on low voltage or low fuel remotely.
- Notification via email or PushOver, Telegram.
- Offline mode.
- Low Bandwidth mode.
- Awesome statistics and graphs.
- Create and manage your own dashboards.
- Windy PWS (Personal Weather Station).
- Engine Hours Logger.
- Polar performance.
- Anything missing? just ask!

## Cloud-hosted PostgSail

Remove the hassle of running PostgSail yourself. Here you can skip the technical setup, the maintenance work and server costs by getting PostgSail on our reliable and secure PostgSail Cloud. Register and try for free at [iot.openplotter.cloud](https://iot.openplotter.cloud/).

PostgSail Cloud is Open Source and free for personal use with a single vessel. If wish to manage multiple boats contact us.

PostgSail is free to use, but is not free to make or host. The stability and accuracy of PostgSail depends on its volunteers and donations from its users. Please consider making an annual recurring gift to PostgSail.

## On-Premise

Self host postgSail where you want and how you want. There are no restrictions, you’re in full control. [Install Guide](https://github.com/xbgmsharp/postgsail/blob/main/docs/README.md)
